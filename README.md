# Crypto Analyzer

`crypto_analyzer.py` is the official entry point for the project.
It exposes three sub-commands to interact with the toolkit:

* `cli` – launch the console interface
* `web` – start the Streamlit interface
* `api` – run the FastAPI service

Example:

```bash
python crypto_analyzer.py web --port 8501
```

Use this script for all invocations; the former
`crypto_analyser.py` file has been removed.
